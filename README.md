## Data Presentation
1. **Overview**
   
   * **Decreased Conversion Rates**: There was a dip in conversion rate from 16.0% in September to 5.1% in October. But then there is rebound in the month of December reaching back to 10.3%.
   * **Reduced Customer Engagement**: There is a decline in overall socail media engagement, with views dropping consistently throughout the year. While the clicks and likes are low compared to views, the click-through rate is 15.37%, meaning that engaged users are still interacting effectively.

 2. **Decreased Conversion Rates**
    * **General Conversion Trend**: Throughout the year, conversion rate varied with highest number of product converting successfully in the months like Jan and Sep. This suggests that while some products had strong seasonal peaks, there is potential to improve conversions in lower-performing months through targeted interventions.
    *  **Lowest Conversion Month**: May experienced the lowest overall conversion rate at 4.5%, with no products standing out significantly in terms of conversion. This indicates a potential need to revisit marketing strategies or promotions during this period to boost performance.
    *   **Highest Conversion Rates**: January recorded the highest overall conversion rate at 19.6%, driven significantly by the Ski Boots with a remarkable 150% conversion. This indicates a strong start to the year, likely fueled by seasonal demand and effective marketing strategies.

## Actions
1. ### Increase Conversion Rate:
   Target High Performing Products - Focus marketing efforts on products with high conversion rates such as, Ski Boots, Kayak, Surfboard and Volleyball. Also, implement seasonal promotions during peak months like January and September to capitalize on these trends. 
3. ### Enhance Customer Engament:
   Revitalize Content Strategy - To turn around declining views and low interaction rates, experiment with more engaging content types like interactive videos. Additionally boost engament by optimizing call-to-action placement in social media and blog content, particularly during historically lower-engagement months (September to December)
4. ### Improve Customer Feedback:
   Address Mixed and Negative Feedback - Implement a feedback loop where mixed and negative reviews are analyzed to identify common issues. Develop improvement plans to address these concerns. Consider following up with dissatisfied customers to resolve issues and encourage re-rating, aiming to move average ratings closer to the 4.0 target.
